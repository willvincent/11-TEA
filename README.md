# 11-TEA
An 11ty starter with Tailwind 3, AlpineJS 3


### Getting started

It's pretty straightforward.

- Clone the repo - since you'll be turning this into your own project, you might consider cloning with degit: `npx degit https://github.com/willvincent/11-TEA`, then you can `git init` and get busy building something awesome.
- Install the node packages with npm or yarn
- start the dev script, `npm run dev`
- Build out your 11ty site. Thanks to the JIT mode of Tailwind, it should be a really enjoyable, speedy process!

When you're ready to deploy you can build for production by running `npm run build` and then deploying things from the 
`dist` directory, or better yet, wire up your repo to Netlify, so that it automagically deploys for you every time you push.
